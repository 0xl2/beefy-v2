            Liquidity protocols are decentralized marketplaces for lenders and borrowers. When a user deposits ${assets[0]} in the vault, Beefy deposits it into the liquidity protocol and borrows against the users ${assets[0]}. This is done at safe levels of collateral.
            The borrowed ${assets[0]} are then redeposited into the platform, and once again used as collateral to borrow more ${assets[0]}. This cycle is repeated multiple times to generate as much interest as possible to buy more ${assets[0]}. It is noteworthy that this "leveraged" multi lending and multi borrowing is only with the ${assets[0]}, so there is no liquidation risk due to token price swings. Also, because of the multi supply/borrow cycle, a transaction fee for these vaults is generally 4x as high as compared to other vaults.
            Because of accruing debt/supply interest, one may notice that the ${assets[0]} amount may decline ever so slightly in between harvests. After the harvest, you will see your ${assets[0]} amount go up as the yields are compounded back into it.

            The BIFI Maxi vault allows users to stake their BIFI much like in the RewardPool, but receive instead their rewards in BIFI. By staking their BIFI, each participant converts and compounds their share of the protocolâ€™s revenue into more BIFI tokens. As no more BIFI tokens are to be minted, these are provided to stakers by buying BIFI from the open market with the networks native token.
